## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Summary

This project involved building a local chatbot using Hugging Face Transformers and deploying it with Gradio. Along the way, I encountered and resolved several technical challenges that strengthened my debugging and deployment skills.

### ‚úÖ Key Issues & Fixes

- **OpenAI API Errors**  
  Initially attempted to use OpenAI‚Äôs API, but ran into authentication and quota issues. Pivoted to Hugging Face‚Äôs open-source models for full local control and transparency.

- **Model Loading Failures**  
  Faced errors when loading Hugging Face models due to missing dependencies and incorrect pipeline usage. Resolved by:
  - Installing `transformers`, `torch`, and `sentencepiece`
  - Using `pipeline("text-generation", model="...")` with correct model names

- **Gradio Interface Crashes**  
  Early Gradio versions caused UI glitches and launch failures. Fixed by:
  - Upgrading to Gradio 4.x
  - Refactoring the interface to use `gr.ChatInterface()` for smoother UX

- **Python Environment Conflicts**  
  Conflicting packages and outdated installs led to runtime errors. Solved by:
  - Creating a clean virtual environment
  - Generating a clean `requirements.txt` with only essential packages

- **GitHub Authentication Issues**  
  Encountered push failures due to missing credentials. Fixed by:
  - Installing Git and configuring username/email
  - Using a personal access token for HTTPS authentication

- **README Rendering Problems**  
  Image links and Markdown formatting didn‚Äôt display correctly on GitHub. Resolved by:
  - Creating an `assets/` folder
  - Renaming and referencing screenshots with clean paths
